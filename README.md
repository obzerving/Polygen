# Polygen
 Inkscape extension that creates a paper model from a silhouette.

Given an open path (silhouette) and a centerline, this program generates (1) one side of an 'n' sided polygonal paper model; top and bottom lids for the assembled model; and (3) a wrapper for the one-sided model.

UPDATE: THIS EXTENSION IS CURRENTLY BROKEN UNDER VERSION 1.4. I HAVE PLACED A VERSION OF THIS EXTENSION THAT APPEARS TO WORK (BUT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED) IN THE beta FOLDER. I AM INTERESTED IN ANY PROBLEMS YOU FIND WITH IT AND HOW IT WORKS WITH VERSIONS 1.1 TO 1.3.

Update: Now allows you to specify the color of solid score lines

Installing:
 
Copy polygen.inx and polygen.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.

Usage:

See the file [How_to_Use_Polygen.pdf](https://github.com/obzerving/Polygen/blob/main/How_to_Use_Polygen.pdf) for details.

Note:

This extension (for Inkscape versions 1.1 to 1.3.) is functional, but not bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document.
